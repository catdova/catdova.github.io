  <div class="annotations">
	<ul>
	<li class="note1">1. Before we even begin, a musical note. The Piano riff that begins this show is actually inspired by a beat I made. I wanted the sound of a door slamming as the downbeat, and in my computer music program I grabbed a sound file called "Door Wood Speak." The sound of the wood squeak was so compelling I set it to notes. Hence the openning riff. Okay. Lets keep going.</li>

	<li class="note2">2. This was originally Written as a Burr monoogue, when Hamilton was still a "concept album" in my head. It wasn't until we realized we were writing a musical that we began to divvy up the monologue among the people who bore witness to Hamilton's life. This owes a debt to the prologue of Sweeny Todd: All our characters set the stage for our main man's entrance.</li>

	<li class="note3">3. It's up to the Treasury Department whether we get to keep this lyric or ont. As of this printing, Hamilton's the dude on the $10 bill.</li>
	<li class="note4">4. At the top of every musical, it's essential to establish the world. Hamilton's early life was marked by trauma and a firsthand view of the brutal practices of the slave trade.</li>

	<li class="note5">5. This is a beautiful letter. Look it up. My favorite phrase in it is that the sceen was "sufficient to strike astonishment into angels"</li>

	<li class="note6">6. From the very beginning, this was how I sang his name. It's an ebsurdly musical name.</li>

	<li class="note7">7. We double the tempo here because Hamilton's found his way out: He's going to double down on his education, and make himself undeniable. The image in my head is of Harry Potter finding out he's a wizard. Everything suddenly makes sense.</li>

	<li class="note8">8. Those who have seen my White House performance will note that these lyrics used to be "In our cowardice and our shame, we will try to destroy your name." Over the course of the show's development, we realized that the story would be told not only by his enemies but by his friends and loved ones. Friend or fore, they're in awe of him</li>

	<li class="note9">9. Of course, the actors who play Mulligan and Lafayette fight with him as friends in Act One, and fight <i>with</i> him as his enemies, Madison and Jefferson in Act Two. It's also true of Laurens/Philip, who "dies for him" in both acts. I was very proud of myself for the double meanings in this section, hence this note.</li>
